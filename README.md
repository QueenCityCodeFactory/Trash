Adds "soft"-delete support to CakePHP 3 tables.

## Install

Using [Composer][composer]:

```
composer require queencitycodefactory/trash
```

You then need to load the plugin. You can use the shell command:

```
bin/cake plugin load QueenCityCodeFactory/Trash
```

or by manually adding statement shown below to `Application.php`:

```php
$this->addPlugin('QueenCityCodeFactory/Trash');
```

## Usage

In your table(s), add the behavior like you would for any other behavior:

```php
// in the initialize() method
$this->addBehavior('QueenCityCodeFactory/Trash.Trash');
```

By default, the behavior will auto-detect the `DATETIME` column used to track trashed (soft-deleted) records but
only if you are using `deleted` or `trashed` as names. Otherwise, you could customize that when adding the behavior:

```php
// in the initialize() method
$this->addBehavior('QueenCityCodeFactory/Trash.Trash', [
    'field' => 'deleted_at'
]);
```

or, at the global level, in `bootstrap.php`:

```php
Configure::write('QueenCityCodeFactory/Trash.field', 'deleted_at');
```

Finally, if you would like to keep the default cake behavior when running `find()` or `delete()` operations and
explicitly call the behavior when you need 'trash'-ing functionality, just disable the event(s):

```php
// in the initialize() method
$this->addBehavior('QueenCityCodeFactory/Trash.Trash', [
    'events' => ['Model.beforeFind'] // enables the beforeFind event only, false to disable both
]);
```

### Cascading deletion
If you'd like to have related records marked as trashed when deleting a parent item, you can just attach the behavior
to the related table classes, and set the `'dependent' => true, 'cascadeCallbacks' => true` options in the table
relationships.

This works on relationships where the item being deleted in the owning side of the relationship. Which means that the
related table should contain the foreign key.

### Custom Finders

- **onlyTrashed** - helps getting only those trashed records.
- **withTrashed** - when filtering out the trashed records by default, this method comes in handy to have them included
as part of certain calls.

### Extras

- **emptyTrash()** - permanently deletes all trashed records.
- **restoreTrash($entity = null)** - restores one (or all) trashed records.
- **trash($entity)** - like `delete()` but for a soft-delete (handy when `Model.beforeDelete` is disabled by default).
- **trashAll(array $conditions)** - like `deleteAll()` but for soft-deletes.

## Patches & Features

* Fork
* Mod, fix
* Test - this is important, so it's not unintentionally broken
* Commit - do not mess with license, todo, version, etc. (if you do change any, bump them into commits of
their own that I can ignore when I pull)
* Pull request - bonus point for topic branches

To ensure your PRs are considered for upstream, you MUST follow the CakePHP coding standards.
